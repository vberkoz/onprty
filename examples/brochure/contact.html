      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <h3>How much do your services cost?</h3>
      <p>Our pricing varies based on project scope, company size, and timeline. Most sustainability audits range from $5,000-$15,000, while ongoing implementation support is typically structured as monthly retainers. We provide detailed proposals after an initial consultation.</p>
      
      <h3>How long does a typical engagement last?</h3>
      <p>Initial audits and strategy development usually take 4-8 weeks. Implementation support can range from 3 months to 2+ years depending on your goals. Many clients start with an audit, then continue with ongoing support.</p>
      
      <h3>Do you work with small businesses?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely! We work with organizations of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies. We offer scaled solutions appropriate for different budgets and organizational complexities.</p>
