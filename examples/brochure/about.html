      <h1>About GreenLeaf Consulting</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2015 by environmental scientists and business strategists, GreenLeaf Consulting emerged from a simple observation: businesses wanted to be more sustainable but didn't know where to start. We set out to bridge that gap.</p>
      <p>What began as a two-person operation in Portland has grown into a team of 25 dedicated professionals serving clients across North America. Our success stems from a fundamental belief that environmental responsibility and business success are not opposing forcesâ€”they're complementary goals that, when properly aligned, create extraordinary value.</p>
      <p>Today, we've completed over 300 sustainability projects, helped clients achieve $15M+ in cost savings, and prevented an estimated 50,000 tons of CO2 emissions. But numbers only tell part of the story. Our real impact is measured in the cultural shifts we help create within organizationsâ€”where sustainability becomes not just a policy, but a core value.</p>
